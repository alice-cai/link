## Description

*Link* is a mobile social media platform designed to help high school and university students access a wide variety of job opportunities and expand their professional network.

## How It Works

Users are given the option to register as a student or an employer.

Students can upload their resumes to their personal profiles, as well as add links to their online portfolios, Linkedin profiles, Github repositories, or personal websites. They are also asked to specify the types of jobs that they are interested in.

The app shows them relevant job listings, and they can choose to *swipe right* to express interest in the job or *swipe left* to reject it.

Similarly, employers can *swipe right* or *swipe left* on student resumes. The resumes are shown to employers with all personal information removed to avoid unconscious biases based on gender or ethnicity.

When a student and employer *swipe right* on each other, they are matched, or *linked*. This allows them to view each other's profiles and contact each other via the messaging feature.

The app also has a data analysis feature that uses linear regression to model the trend of matches and rejections for each student. It also shows the student how many matches and rejections they've gotten per job category.
